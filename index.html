		<h2>The Year without Maggie</h2>
		<img src="http://41.media.tumblr.com/a15961d814af3fc95d6abf76526ed37c/tumblr_inline_nteg2dn2101twnqsc_1280.jpg">
		<p>As the year progresses, let's all take a moment of silence for our dear friend Maggie the Magnolia tree. Despite her untimely death, the school has left her sitting on Lehman lawn--perhaps as a reminder to the student body of our once glorious past? Whatever the reason, it seems a cruel response to dear Maggie's passing. Word on the street, however, is that minnie Maggie clones are currently being grown in the greenhouse? Could it be that there is a glimpse of hope for Barnard's future tree relations? Stay tuned.</p>

		<h2>Hewitt Scaffolding</h2>

		<p>If you live in Hewitt this year, you have undoubtedly been subject to the *extensive* construction/inspection that has been happening outside our lovely building. If you are one of the lucky few, this event has affected you in no way beyond slightly hindering your beautiful view of the quad (or Claremont). If you are part of the majority, however, you have been subject to the seemingly unendless sound of drills and hammers right outside your window. In an email sent out at the beginning of the year, it said the workers would be gone by October, and yet here we are. When will this migraine-inducing inconvenience pass? Will we ever be free to live our Hewitt lives in peace and quiet again? One can only hope.</p>

		<h2>Midterms in Morningside Heights</h2>
		<img src="http://alivecampus.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Studying.jpg">
		<p>Their's a slight chill in the air, leaves are just starting to turn, and the libraries are overflowing with students reading stacks of books and papers bigger then their heads. Yep--midterms season is upon us, that glorious time of year when Barnumbia destroys us all. To bring some excitement into this midterms season, why not try a new study spot? My favorite on-campus location is Avery Library, but get creative! Don't forget that we are in New York City, meaning that there is a total overflow of cool places to study around the city. Don't get stuck in the Columbia bubble! There is more to this city than Butler Library!</p>
